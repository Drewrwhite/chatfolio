I am currently working as a Data Engineer/Consultant while continuing to grow my skills particularly in AI and LLMs. In addition to my main focus of data engineering, I also enjoy studying other elements of software development to assist in gaining a deeper understanding of the tech industry as a whole! In my free time, I enjoy creating and listening to music, doing Danzan Ryu Ju-Jitsu, and spending time in the beautiful outdoors, exploring with my wife and two daughters.",
